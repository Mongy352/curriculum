Web development apprenticeship curriculum and learning materials

##Structure
The repo is set out as a reference tool, grouping documents by their type. Once we have a comprehensive library in place we can add layers to group lessons, tasks and tutorials in different ways or as standalone courses.
1. *Lessons* - Lesson plans for group training delivered by an experiences web development professional
2. *Tutorials* - 'How to' documents as reference for apprentices to achieve common tasks without supervision
3. *Tasks* - Challenges in the form of problems to be solved with code or development techniques (these may move to separate repos)
