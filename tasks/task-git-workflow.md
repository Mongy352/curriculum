## Round 1


## Review
The idea is for them to organise another couple of 'sprints' and have all the changes merged into master. They will probably need reminding of the workflow but ask them to tell you what they were doing first to see how much they remember.  Each task is done in a new branch which is then pushed to the repo and a Pull Request created for review and merge into master. The previous workflow was a bit of a free for all with everyone doing work as quickly as they could and Miles approving the pull requests as they came in.

I would suggest the following steps

Ask them to tell you about what they did last time
What did the columns mean
How did cards move from one column to another
Who was in charge
Ask them what would be a better system - Steer them towards something like the following

One task each in the doing column before you start a 'sprint'
Each person locally completes the task and pushes the branch to master
Create PR for the merge of your branch move to the done column
At the end of a sprint someone from the group plugs into the display screen to review pull requests
does it do what the card said?
check no conflicts / investigate conflicts
reject / merge
Once code is merged into master card moved to 'Deployed' column
If rejected it goes back into doing
- the owner can sort out issues locally with help from other team members while the review continues < OR > they can add it to the next sprint
Before the next sprint starts let's tidy up the board
Anything in doing that is not started move back to Backlog
Anything in Done that has been merged move to deployed
Review any open Pull Requests and merge
